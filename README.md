# HKUST-COMP3711-Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms

This is a compilation of materials including lecture notes, assignments, and solutions etc. for the course HURST COMP3711 Design and Analysis of Algorithms


[Course Introduction]:

This course presents the fundamental techniques for designing efficient computer algorithms, proving their correctness, and analyzing their running times. General topics include mathematical analysis of algorithms (summations and recurrences), advanced data structures (balanced search trees), algorithm design techniques (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms), graph algorithms (breadth-first and depth-first search, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths).

On successful completion of this course, students are expected to be able to (intended learning outcomes):

Describe fundamental concepts and techniques for determining the asymptotic behavior of real-valued functions defined in natural numbers.
Explain recurrence equations and solve common recurrences using a variety of techniques.
Analyze an algorithm described in plain language or some form of pseudocode in terms of its time (or space) efficiency as a function of the size of a problem instance.
Explain how various data structures, including trees, heaps and disjoint set structures, influence the time efficiency of algorithms.
Apply general algorithmic design and analysis techniques to solving problems, including greedy, divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming.
Identify randomization in algorithms and analyze basic randomized algorithms such as randomized quicksort and selection.
